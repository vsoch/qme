# QueueMe Examples

The following examples show how you can package QueueMe alongside software in a
container to keep track of commands run within it. If you use Docker, the database
will persist as long as the container is running (unless you bind it somewhere
to your host) and if you use Singularity, the usage can be seamless.

 - [nltk-docker](nltk-docker): Create a dashboard for a container installed with nltk to perform basic text processing commands.

You should also look at [tutorials](https://vsoch.github.io/qme/tutorials/) for the QueueMe documentation for more examples.
