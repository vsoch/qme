               containers and reproducibility to scientific computing. Using
               Singularity containers, developers can work in reproducible
               environments of their choosing and design, and these complete
               environments can easily be copied and executed on other
               platforms. Singularity is an open source initiative that
               harnesses the expertise of system and software engineers and
               researchers alike, and integrates seamlessly into common
               workflows for both of these groups. As its primary use case,
               Singularity brings mobility of computing to both users and HPC
               centers, providing a secure means to capture and distribute
               software and compute environments. This ability to create and
               deploy reproducible environments across these centers, a
               previously unmet need, makes Singularity a game changing
               development for computational science.",
